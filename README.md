# Linear Regression 

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The goal is to predict the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. The equation of a simple linear regression line is y=mx+b.

# Logistic Regression 

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category. Instead of predicting a continuous outcome, it predicts the probability of a binary outcome (0 or 1). The logistic function (sigmoid function) is used to constrain the output to a range between 0 and 1.
